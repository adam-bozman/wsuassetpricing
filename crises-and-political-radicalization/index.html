## Contributions

&gt; "We show that the German banking crisis not only reduced output, but also had important political consquences, boosting the electoral fortunes of the Nazi party through both economic and noneconomic channels."

_These results suggest an **important synergy between financial distress and cultural predispositions**, with far-reaching and contemporary consequences._

# Historical Background

layout: true

## Historical Background

---

### The Great Depression in Germany

.center[_The Great Depression in Germany ranked among the worst worldwide.  Peak to trough, German industrial output fell by 40% **(only surpassed in severity by the United States)._**]

- **The Great Depression (in general) hit countries indebted to the United States the hardest**

- **Much of Germany's additional exposure came following the Treaty of Versailles** 

- By 1933, one third of its workforce was unemployed

- Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act prevented (effectively) most German industries from trading in foreign markets

- From 1929 to 1933, German exports had declined by over 60%

---

### The Banking Crisis of 1931

&gt; "When the scale of Danatbank's problems became public in July 1931, the ensuing bank run among retail depositers led to **a suspension of bank deposits, the failure of Danat and Dresdner Bank, a three-week bank holiday, and Germany's de facto exit from the gold standard.**"

.pull-left[
#### Danatbank

- Initial run began following rumors of insolvency of textiles
- Sparked what would become known as the "twin crisis," a fragile banking system faltering due to foreign withdrawals and a run on the Mark
- **No evidence that Danatbank was laxer in its lending standards than other large banks**

]

.pull-right[
#### Dresdner

- The largest bank in Germany (AUMs)
- Would ultimately be restructured in 1931
- Danatbank would merge with Dresdner

]

### The Rise of the Nazi Party

_Nazi propaganda exploited the 1931 banking crisis, which provided seemingly incontrovertible proof in support of their misguided theories of Jewish domination and destruction._ 

&gt; Nazi propaganda led to a belief that "an ever-increasing convergence towards national socialist language and national socialist thought. The turning point came approximately during the summer crisis of 1931... the conflict between Germany's vital needs and those of the global economic and financial policy can no longer be obscured."  

- Between 1930 and March 1933 the Nazi's popular vote went from 18.3% to 43.9%

- In this same time, the Nazi party received the majority in parliament (37.4% more than Social Democrats and Communists combined)

- **Jakob Goldschmidt became a scapegoat for Germany's banking crises**

# The Data &amp; Main Variables

## The Data &amp; Main Variables 

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Data]

#### Data Sources
_"We collect data for the universe of German joint stock companies in 1929 to construct a measure of a municipality's exposure to Danatbank."_

- The Handbook of German Joint Stock Companies
- Annual compendium of balance sheet information (5,610 firms)
- In aggregate, the combined data sources account for 40% of GDP and two-thirds of all non-financial assets in 1929 

![:scale 70%](img/eq1.png)

**German banks lent nationwide in the 1930s (unlike in the US)**, so the authors exploit cross-sectional variation in firms' and cities' precrisis exposure to banks to identify the effect of the banking crisis on voting.

.panel[.panel-name[Descriptive Statistics]
.pull-left[
![:scale 150%](img/tab1.png)
]

.pull-right[

- In aggregate, this main data set contains information on 209 major German cities (population 20 million)

- The Nazi party's vote share increased by 17.2% on average between 1930 and July 1932

- The mean city had 86,700 inhabitants, 41.7% was 'blue collar'. Protestants made up 65.7% of the population, while Jews made up 0.9%

- In 22% of cities, anti-Semitic parties received votes before 1914, while 24.4% engaged in a pogrom at some point prior to 1929

- A Danat branch existed in 46.4% of cities

- Table II examines the balancedness of city-level covariates

- These are **multivariate regressions with _Danat, Branch, or Exposure_ as the dependent variable**

- Across specifications, **only population is consistently significant**
  - The authors control for log population throughout their analysis
  
- Danat exposure is not systematically correlated with the share of blue-collar workers, percentage of Jews/Protestants, precrisis income per capita, or the unemploymment rate

## Main Results

### Danatbank &amp; Nazi Voting

.pull-left[

![:scale 100%](img/eq2.png)

![:scale 90%](img/fig2.png)
]

.pull-right[

_"Figure 2 highlights our main findings."_

- This figure **plots the distributions of the change in vote shares for the Nazi Party between September 1930 and July 1932** 

- The Nazis gained votes throughout the country, but the distribution is shifted sharply to the right for Danat-exposed cities where _National-sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands_ (NSDAP) increased by an additional 15% of the mean vote change

- Authors use both exposure to _Danat_ as an indicator (Equation 2)

### Danatbank &amp; Nazi Voting

.center[![:scale 55%](img/tab3.png)]

---

### Economic Channel

&gt; How did the banking crisis boost support for the Nazi party?  There are two plausible channels.  **First**, Danat's default led to economic misery, which could have translated into greater Nazi backing.  **Second**, scapegoating Jews (and the hated Weimar political and financial system allegedly dominated by Jews) for the economic depression was a key element of Nazi propaganda.

### Danat vs Dresdner

.pull-left[
![:scale 100%](img/tab6.png)
]

.pull-right[

_"In Table VI, we contrast the differential effects of Danat's and Dresdner's presence in more detail, as both banks failed during the crisis."_

- Column (1) and (2) show that the presence of either failing bank led to a virtually identical decline in city incomes

- **The electoral effect was, however, strikingly different**: column (3) shows that the presence of Dresdner alone does not significantly predict changes in voting

- Adding Danat to column (4), we see that Danat's presence has a highly significant effect on support for the NSDAP

]

### Persecution after 1933

.pull-left[

![:scale 100%](img/tab7.png)

]

.pull-right[

_"Table VII shows that anti-Semitic actions and violence were more frequent in locations affected by Danatbank's failure."_

- Columns (1) to (3) include city-level controls, and columns (4) to (6) add province fixed effects

- Results from column (4) imply that having any exposure to Danat increased anti-Semitic violence by approximately 0.27 standard deviations

- Combined, these results lead to the conclusion that anti-Semitic sentiment triggered by the banking crisis had repurcussions long after Danat's failure

]

---

### Antifinance Sentiment

.pull-left[

![:scale 100%](img/tab9.png)
]

.pull-right[

As anti-Semitic and more general antifinance attitudes are often highly correlated, especially in Germany (Becker and Pascali (2019)), **these results may also reflect general antifinance sentiment.**

- Using votes for the VRP, a party that sought a revaluation of (old) Marks as an indicator of suffering and antipathy toward the financial section

- The only variable that emerges as strongly significant is the presence of Danatbank

- The inclusion of antifinance sentiment and the cross-sectional involvement of Jews in finance did not matter differential during the crisis

# Conclusions &amp; Future Research

---

## Conclusions &amp; Future Research 

&gt; "What has been missing from the literature on the real effects of financial crises is **a clear link between financial distress and broad-based radicalization of the electorate"**

### Recap:

- The surge in Nazi voting was more pronounced in cities with a long history of anti-Semitism (Danat's presence added 6% to electoral gains)
- Exposure to Danat had a much stronger effect on Nazi voting - possibly reflecting Danat's Jewish chairman
- These results suggest a synergy between economic and cultural factors that propagate populism and fanatics

### Prospects:

- Néstor Kirchner - Argentina's '01 crisis
- U.S. Populism following '08 crisis - [FT Article](https://www.ft.com/content/687c0184-aaa6-11e8-94bd-cba20d67390c)
