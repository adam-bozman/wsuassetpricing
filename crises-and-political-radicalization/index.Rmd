## Contributions

> "We show that the German banking crisis not only reduced output, but also had important political consquences, boosting the electoral fortunes of the Nazi party through both economic and noneconomic channels."

_These results suggest an important synergy between financial distress and cultural predispositions, with far-reaching and contemporary consequences._

### The Great Depression in Germany

.center[_The Great Depression in Germany ranked among the worst worldwide.  Peak to trough, German industrial output fell by 40% (only surpassed in severity by the United States)._]

- The Great Depression (in general) hit countries indebted to the United States the hardest

- Much of Germany's additional exposure came following the Treaty of Versailles 

- By 1933, one third of its workforce was unemployed

- Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act prevented (effectively) most German industries from trading in foreign markets

- From 1929 to 1933, German exports had declined by over 60%

# Conclusions & Future Research

---

## Conclusions & Future Research 

> "What has been missing from the literature on the real effects of financial crises is **a clear link between financial distress and broad-based radicalization of the electorate"**

### Recap:

- The surge in Nazi voting was more pronounced in cities with a long history of anti-Semitism (Danat's presence added 6% to electoral gains)
- Exposure to Danat had a much stronger effect on Nazi voting - possibly reflecting Danat's Jewish chairman
- These results suggest a synergy between economic and cultural factors that propagate populism and fanatics

### Prospects:

- Néstor Kirchner - Argentina's '01 crisis
- U.S. Populism following '08 crisis - [FT Article](https://www.ft.com/content/687c0184-aaa6-11e8-94bd-cba20d67390c)
- How the '14 Russian Oil Crisis enabled the annexation of Crimea and the current invasion of Ukraine
