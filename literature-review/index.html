## Cyber risk and the U.S. financial system

---

### Data &amp; Methodology

"We model how a cyber attack may be amplified through the U.S. financial system, focusing on the wholesale payments network."

Analogies come from SWIFT - Andrew's interested in SWIFT alternatives - potentially crypto, right?

With respect to the literature on theoretical bank runs A pre-moretem analysis to uncover ways that attacks may be amplified, using comprehensive Fedwire data on wholesale payments between financial instiutions in the U.S.
(data is restricted to Fedwire - Fed employee)



---

### Questiions &amp; Conclusions

All data comes from Federal Reserve Bank of New York employees - inherently confidential.

Authors estimate that spillovers of an attack on one of the five most active banks would impair 31% of the network, on average (some days being significantly worse). 

Alternative scenarios: 

Other banks respond with liquidity hoarding, forgone payment activity could reach more than 2.5 times daily GDP.  

Reverse stress tests also show attacks on groups of small banks could impair a significant amount of the network.  

Additionally, through third-party providers and financial market utilities pose additional risks - (expand)

**Restrictions:**
1,827 coins in total 
Daily close prices to construct weekly coin returns

**A New 3-Factor Model**

Principal Component Analysis
PC1 strongly correlates with the cryptocurrency size factor
PC2 is significantly exposed to the cryptocurrency momentum factor 
These two account for 45% of the variation

A reduction from 24 to 10 characteristics that are statistically significant

CMKT (Cryptocurrency Market Factor)
- Value-weighted return of all cryptos and U.S. T-Bill
CSMB (Cryptocurrency Size Factor)
- Accounts for mkt cap, price, max day pric, price volume, and stdev of price volume
CMOM (Cryptocurrency Momentum Factor)
- accounts for one-week, two-week, three-week, four-week, and one-to-four week momentum strategies

Followed FF 1993 2X3 sorts 

Size mkt cap: bottom 30% small, middle 40% mid, and top 30% B

CMOM = 1/2(Small High + Big High) - 1/2(Small Low + Big Low)

### Questions &amp; Conclusions

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Size as a Proxy]

&gt; A common critique of corss-sectional trading strategies... **studies show that the size effect in the equity market is weak outside of the original Banz (1981) sample.** 

2 Points:
1. Size may proxy for an illiquidity premium
1. The tradeoff between capital gains and the convenience yield: in equilibrium, **the convenience yield of larger and more mature cryptocurrencies is higher, and thus their capital gain should be lower** (Sockin and Xiong, 2018)

Smaller coins have lower prices and higher illiquidity, relative to larger coins
The CSMB is greater among coins that have higher arbitrage costs
In the time series, CSMB is higher at times of high market volatility

The CSMB is significantly and positively exposed to stdev of crypto market returns, suggesting that the CSMB performs well in a more volatile market (supporting the liquidity view of the size premium)
]
.panel[.panel-name[Momentum Effect]
&gt; "We find that cryptocurrency momentum effect is strong at relatively short horizons" (&lt;1 Month)

Following the behavioral underreaction channel, momentum should be stronger among assets that receive less attention
- Long-short momentum strategy in the below-median size group generates insignificant weekly returns
- Long-short strategy in the above-median size group generates statistically significant 3.2% weekly returns

CMOM is more pronounced among coins with high attention as proxied by trading volume (assuming accurate volume estimates)
- In contrast to equity markets, potentially too much uncertainty

]
.panel[.panel-name[Conclusions]
"This paper shows that the cross-section of cryptocurrencies can be meaningfully analyzed using standard asset pricing tools." 

While the authors provide evidence to support some plausible mechanisms behind the CSMB and CMOM effects, these channels are only plausible explanations.

This market is still very young, and **there is not guarantee that these results will hold in the future** (2022 Bust)

Still, these results **may act as a proxy to other new/emerging asset classes** that may come into existence in the future

## Is Bitcoin Really Untethered?

### Data &amp; Methodology

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Data]
.pull-left[
All Pricing Data comes from CoinAPI.io

&gt; "Ironically, new large entities have gained centralized control over the vast majority of operations in the cryptocurrency world, such as centralized exchanges that handle the majority of transactions and **stable coin issuers that can control the supply of money like a central bank.**"

**iFinex &gt; Bitfinex &gt; Tether**

]

.pull-right[
.center[![bitcoin](img/bitcoinpic.png)]
]

]
.panel[.panel-name[Methodology]

#### Pushed 

Tether's price relative to the USD may increase as a consequence of strong investor demand, and Tether may also be driven by its usefulness as a facilitator of cross-exchange arbitrage to eliminate pricing discrepancies across cryptocurrency exchanges.

#### PUlled

If Tether issuers are trying to provide stability to the market during downtourns, outflows of Tether and purchases of Bitcoin by Bitfinex may follow periods of negative Bitcoin returns.  Bitcoin returns may show a return reversal after negative returns.  If tether is not fully backed by USD/Euro at the outset, but issuers want to signal otherwise to investors by releasing EOM accounting statements, then Tether creators may liquidate Bitcoins into USD to demonstrate sufficient reserves.

### Questions and Conclusions

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[High-flow Events]
.pull-left[
.contain[![bitcoin](img/bitcoinpic.png)]
]
.pull-right[

- When removing the top 5% and 10% of hours (volume), returns are 67.2% and 79.2% lower, respectively
- A monte-carlo simulation excluding these highest hours returns just 221% (March 1, 2017 - March 31st, 2018) buy-and-hold

**Replacing these top 1% of hours with other randomly selected hours, none of the 10,000 simulations return close to this actual return.**

]

]
.panel[.panel-name[1LSg]

.pull-left[

![](img/1lsg.png)
]
.pull-right[

Remember the single player scenario? 1LSg received over half of all Bitcoin flows on Bitfinex exchange (March 1, 2017 - March 31, 2018)

_"The high 1LSg flow hours are the top 1% of hours with high 1LSg flows,"_ which similarly follows with the top 5% and 10% of 1LSg flows. 

Note: For the net Tether/Bitcoin flows associated with the other five main Tether-based exchanges (Binance, HitBTC, Huobi, Kraken, and OKEx), **removing the top 1%, 5%, and 10% of flows has no effect on simulated Bitcoin prices.**

]
]
.panel[.panel-name[Conclusions]

The authors established that one large player on Bitfinex uses Tether to purchase large amounts of Bitcoin when prices are following the printing of Tether (consistent with the supply-driven hypothesis).

&gt; "More broadly, these findings also suggest that innovative technologies designed to bypass traditional banking systems have not eliminated the need for external surveillance, monitoring, and a regulatory framework." 

Following this papers publication, the State of New York Office of the Attorney General ordered Bitfinex and Tether to pay $18.5 million (nominal relative to some other recent SEC crackdowns)

_"Bitfinex and Tether recklessly and unlawfully covered-up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines."_

## Availability, recency, and sophistication in &lt;/br&gt; the repurchasing behavior of retail investors

---

### Data &amp; Methodology

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Data]

Data is composed of 1.9 million trades made by approximately 80,000 households between January 1991 to November 1996.  

&gt; Individual investor trading data at a large discount borkerage house indicates that repurchasing is a fairly pervasive behavior, with about **40% of all households making at least one repurchase**. These 'repurchasing households' account for **nearly 80% (848,388 trades) of the total number and nearly 90% ($10.55 billion) of the value of all stock purchases at this brokerage house**.  

]
.panel[.panel-name[Methodology]

The authors construct probit regressions with dummy variables for various stocks and investor characteristics (e.g., profit, size, extreme_ret, tech_stk) in an attempt to test repurchased stocks for characteristics that might proxy for a high degree of attention and test for types of investors who engage in repurchases.  

There were marginally significant investor preferences for repurchasing stocks previously sold for a profit along with repurchasing stocks that were in the previous day's highest-return decile, but the most significant result was the recency effect.  

With regard to diversification, investors who repurchase more often tend to have less-diversified portfolios.

]
]
---

### Questions and Conclusions

Retail investors face time and information constraints, causing them to use cognitive shortcuts and heuristics.  **Investors will use readily available information and repurchase stocks that are touted in the news or stocks in which they previously made a profit** - _a gambler's mindset._

Investors display a preference for repurchasing stocks with large positive returns on the previous day and a few large-cap stcoks in a few industries.  Of the repurchases, 36% are in the technology sector and about 14% are in the pharmaceutical and retail sectors.  **These stocks are easy for investors to recall because of wide analyst coverage, heavy advertising, and/or news headlines.**

Nofsinger concludes that the recency of a trade plays a significant role in the repurchase decision and this behavior is suboptimal and associated with less sophisticated investors.

- **Resolute** - Avoid issues with census restructuring and movement around representatives

### Questions &amp; Conclusions

"The critical component of the economic mechanism of moral hazard is the rational belief or expectation by market participants of outside intervention in adverse states of the world." 

&gt; Moral hazard has been a staple of economic theory since the 1960s, **but economists know little about how firm incentives are affected by potential future government intervention.**

- In the sample from 1973 - 2009, the author finds a positive relationship between political connections and risk taking, as measured by stock volatility and/or leverage ratios
- In a more narrow sample, the author finds that politically connected firms had higher leverage prior to the 2008 financial crisis and increased their leverage more in response to local housing price growth
  - **But** they were also less likely to go bankrupt or go insolvent during and after the financial crisis **and** had higher stock returns during this crisis
  
There have been a number of new campaign finance laws and court rulings in the last decade (_Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission_)
- How do these impact corporate campaign expenditures?
- How do these findings impact industries like defense (Senate Armed Services Committee) and health care (Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee)

## The customer knows best: &lt;br&gt; The investment value of consumer opinions 

---

### Data &amp; Methodology

&gt; July 2004 - December 2015, 14.5 million customer reviews of 270,000 different products were posted on Amazon.com

- Huang looks at panel data from 346 public firms (primarily business equipment, consumer nondurables, and manufacturing)
  - This sample is considerably larger than prior literature with similar methodology
  
- Baseline financial data comes from CRSP, Compustat, and I/B/E/S 

- Panel data covers firm months, with each month having at least 10 reviews and, on average, including 150 stocks

- Regressions assess the determinants of the abnormal ratings - examining the ratings' investment value, their predictive effect for future returns, and their status as new information applying Fama-Macbeth tests
---

### Questions &amp; Conclusions

_**Consumer opinions are shown to provide new value-relevant information for stock investing via analysis of millions of customer product reviews posted on Amazon.com** - this return predictability holds over time, remains after controlling for firm characteristics, and can signal revenue and earnings surprises._

- A spread portfolio constructed to purchase stocks with abnormal favorable customer ratings in the top tercile and selling stocks in the bottom tercile **generates and abnormal monthly return of 55bps to 73 bps**
  - These ratings may positively predict revenue and earnings surprises and net purchases by hedge fund managers

- These results are **concentrated among stocks in less efficient market sectors** (small cap/low analyst coverage)

- **Anecdotal evidence says that customer postings are curated online, particularly by smaller companies striving to gain attention via fictitious reviews**

## Do Schocks to Personal Wealth Affect Risk-taking in Delegated Portfolios 

---

### Data &amp; Methodology

&gt; "Using exogenous wealth shocks stemming from the collapse of the housing market, we show that managers who experience substantial losses in their home values subsequently reduce risk in their delegated funds."

_If managers' risk preferences change following a negative shock to personal wealth, they may reduce risk-taking in the delegated fund simply to reduce the risk of their personal portfolios._

- Data comes from a merged CRSP-Morningstar panel, resulting in 5,146 fund-manager pairs as of the fourth quarter 2006
  - Housing data comes from Zillow

- A personal leverage ratio for managers is given by collecting mortgage information from the LexisNexis Public Records database

## Central Bank Digital Currency and Banks

### Data &amp; Methodology 

&gt; "We show that CBDC need not reduce bank lending unless friction and synergies bind deposits and lending together... Our counterfactual analysis shows that a **CBDC can replace a significant fraction of bank deposits, especially when it pays interest.**"

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Deposits &amp; Lending]

- Even assuming a 'quality discount', (Table 3) suggests that when CBDC is introduced, it competes with bank deposits and results in lower deposit shares for banks
- Assuming non-interest-bearing CBDC, more yield-sensitive households will be more likely to deposit with banks
- CBDC influences banks' funding structure, **banks need to substitute their lost deposits with more expensive wholesale borrowings**
- Assuming banks substitute deposits with wholesale funding, one dollar increase in CBDC reduces bank lending by 34 cents
- If the Fed pays an interest rate that equals the current federal funds rate, the interest-bearing CBDC will be able to capture an additional 30% of the deposit market

_"Our analysis shows that the introduction of CBDC can significantly impair the attractiveness of bank deposits and lead to outflows of deposit funding."_

As banks' external financing cost starts to increase, **banks will cut their loan provisions further because they now face higher costs to replace the  lost deposit funding.**

.panel[.panel-name[Big v. Small]

"There is large heterogeneity in banks' external financing frictions across the size distribution."

- Banks in the top one percentile as big banks (the rest small)
- Smaller banks face particularly high frictions in accessing the wholesale funding market
- Big banks are able to rely on their wholesale funding access to replace lost deposits

.pull-right[
![](img/bigsmall.png)
]
]
]

---

### Counterfactuals &amp; Conclusions

&gt; "We first clarify an important conceptual issue underlying many extant debates about CBDC, that is, **CBDC need not to reduce bank lending unless frictions and synergies bind deposits and lending together."**

- Evaluating the potential impact of CBDC on bank lending is effectively an evaluation of magnitudes of these frictions and synergies

  - CBDC could replace a significant fraction of bank deposits, especially when it pays interest
  
  - However, CBDC would have a much smaller impact on bank lending because banks could replace a large fraction of the lost deposits with wholesale funding (big banks)
  
  - This also may cause banks' funding costs to be more sensitive to short-term rates, **increasing their exposure to interest rate risk**

### Summary &amp; Conclusions

&gt; "As for the analogy of cooking, the successful design of a learning system depends on the combination of the right ingredients as well as the experience of the chef."

#### An Important Note

- An increasing quantity of **granular micro or high-frequency data** are becoming available to central banks and regulators, including **single asset holdings and transactions of financial institutions, individual household portfolios and consumption behaviours, firms' investment and hiring strategies, payments data, etc.**

#### Potential Drawbacks

1. **The difference between causal inference and prediction**, where ML tools often ignore the issue of endogeneity
1. **The interpretability of many techniques**, where a model's parameters or outputs cause confusion ('black boxes' in neural networks)
1. **The modelling of time**, where an ignorance arises in cross-sectional approaches
